##Pre-Installation
###Check Release Integrity

You **must** verify the integrity of the [downloaded file](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/com/floragunn/search-guard-ssl/2.1.0.1/). We provide PGP signatures for every release file. This signature should be matched against the KEYS file. We also provide MD5 and SHA-1 checksums for every release file. After you download the file, you should calculate a checksum for your download, and make sure it is the same as ours. [Here](http://www.openoffice.org/download/checksums.html) and [here](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html) are some tips how to verify the pgp signatures.

##Installation
Install it like any other Elasticsearch plugin

``sudo bin/plugin install com.floragunn/search-guard-ssl/2.1.0.3``

Prerequisites:

* Java 7 or 8 (recommended)
* Elasticsearch 2.1.0
* Optional: Tomcat Native and Open SSL, see [wiki](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard-ssl/wiki)

Build it yourself:

* Install maven 3.1+
* ``git clone https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard-ssl.git``
* ``cd search-guard-ssl``
* execute ``mvn package -DskipTests`` 


##Configuration

Search Guard SSL configuration is done in elasticsearch.yml. Please refer to [searchguard-ssl-config-template.yml](searchguard-ssl-config-template.yml) to see the configuration options and their defaults.

Note:

* ``security.manager.enabled`` - Must currently be set to ``false``. This will likely change with Elasticsearch 2.2, see [PR 14108](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/14108)

Check your configuration by visiting [https://localhost:9200/_searchguard/sslinfo?pretty](https://localhost:9200/_searchguard/sslinfo?pretty) if you have enabled HTTPS or [http://localhost:9200/_searchguard/sslinfo?pretty](http://localhost:9200/_searchguard/sslinfo?pretty) if HTTPS is not enabled.

For details refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/floragunncom/search-guard-ssl/wiki).



###Logging
Configured in elasticsearch's logging.yml. Nothing special. To enable debug just add

``logger.com.floragunn.searchguard.ssl: DEBUG``


###SSL Certificates
* Refer to [example-pki-scripts](example-pki-scripts) how to generate the certificates. It's strongly recommended to use a root certificate.
* See also [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-keytool-essentials-working-with-java-keystores](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-keytool-essentials-working-with-java-keystores)
* or [https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/ssl-howto.html](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/ssl-howto.html)

###Update and Upgrade
